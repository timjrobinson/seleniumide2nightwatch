# WARNING: Package unmaintained and mostly not working

I recommend using something else to convert your selenium files, this package doesn't do much and is quite buggy. Happy to accept PR's though, if anyone wants to develop this. 

If you find an alternative that works well let me know and I'll add it to this README. 


## Description

Converts SeleniumIDE export files to nightwatch runnable js files. For when you want to automate your selenium testing.

## Usage

```
npm install -g side2nw
```

```
side2nw /Path/To/SeleniumExportedFile
```
